= Documatic

Documatic is an OpenDocument extension for Ruby Reports (Ruport). It
is a template-driven formatter that can be used to produce attractive
printable documents such as database reports, invoices, letters, faxes
and more.

As of version 0.1.0, Documatic supports OpenDocument text and
spreadsheet formats.

== Installation

Documatic can be installed via Rubygems.

  % gem install documatic


== Usage

You can load Documatic as a gem when your program is initialised:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'documatic'

Documatic will then be available as a formatter for your Ruport
tables, groups and groupings.  Rendering using an OpenDocument text
template is done like this:

  data.to_odt_template(:template_file => 'path/filename.odt',
                       :output_file   => 'output-path/filename.odt')

Rendering using an OpenDocument spreadsheet is done like this:

  data.to_ods_template(:template_file => 'path/filename.ods',
                       :output_file   => 'output-path/filename.ods')

Documatic creates the output path if required.

The wiki (see below) has more documentation and examples, plus simple
tutorials to illustrate how text and spreadsheet rendering works.
